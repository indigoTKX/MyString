# String
My realisation of String class
It allows to work with c-style strings (arrays of chars) via easy and convinient interface avoiding all the troubles with pointers and memory leaks.
There are two constructors, one creates a string, copying a given string, and another creates a string with given amount of elements equal to a given symbol. 
By default it creates an empty string.
It has all the instruments to safely copy it,
